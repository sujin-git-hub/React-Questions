Styling

1.	Is State part of DOM tree structure?<br/>
     No both are diffrent.<br/>
  	**Dom:**<br/>
  	  The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.<br/>
  	  It represents the web page, that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.<br/>  	  
3.	How many ways of Styling possible in react
        **1. Inline Styles**.<br/>
               Styles are applied directly to elements using the style attribute..<br/>
               **Example:** <div style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: '14px' }}>Hello World</div>.<br/>
               Simple to use, scoped to the component, easy to apply conditional styles.<br/>
               Limited features (e.g., no pseudo-classes), can lead to poor performance due to creating new objects on each render.<br/>
