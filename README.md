1.	# React-Questions<br/><br/>Is State part of DOM tree structure?<br/>No both are different.<br/>Dom:<br/>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.<br/>It represents the web page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.<br/>How many ways of Styling possible in react<br/>Inline Styles<br/>Styles are applied directly to elements using the style attribute<br/> <div style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: '14px' }}> Hello World </div><br/>Simple to use, easy to apply conditional styles.<br/>Limited features (e.g., no pseudo-classes), can lead to poor performance due to creating new objects on each render.<br/>CSS Stylesheets<br/>CSS files are used to style components. <br/> <br/>Styles are applied using className, id, etcâ€¦.<br/>Easy to manage for global styles, good for large projects.<br/>Styles are global by default, so harder to apply dynamic styles.<br/>CSS Modules<br/>CSS files where class and animation names are scoped locally by default.<br/> <br/>No global namespace, avoids class name collisions, and easy to use.<br/>Slightly more complex setup, harder to share styles globally.<br/>Styled Components (CSS-in-JS)<br/>A popular library for writing component-level styles in JavaScript files. Styles are tied to specific components.<br/> <br/>Scoped to components, easy to apply dynamic styles, supports theming, and good for component-based systems.<br/>Can be slower in some cases, adds complexity and overhead, potentially larger bundle sizes.<br/>Styled JSX<br/>Scoped CSS within components, often used with Next.js.<br/> <br/>Styles are scoped to the component, easy integration with Next.js.<br/>Limited to JSX, less powerful than some CSS-in-JS libraries. <br/>3rd party library<br/>styling 3rd party library<br/>How to handle JWT token?<br/>A JSON Web Token (JWT) is URL-safe token format.<br/>It can be used to transfer data securely between the client and a server. <br/>JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications.<br/>Best place to store JWT<br/>HTTP-Only Cookies (Recommended for Security)<br/>HTTP-only cookies are sent automatically by the browser with every request to the server, and they cannot be accessed by JavaScript running on the client.<br/>Pros:<br/>Provides protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, as JavaScript cannot read or manipulate the token.<br/>Can be set with the Secure flag, ensuring the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.<br/>Cons:<br/>Requires careful handling to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This can be mitigated by using anti-CSRF tokens.<br/>Use Case: <br/>Ideal for storing JWTs in applications where security is a top priority, such as financial or healthcare applications.<br/>Local Storage (Common but Less Secure)<br/>Local Storage is a web storage API that allows you to store data in the browser. It is accessible via JavaScript.<br/>Pros:<br/>Easy to implement and retrieve the token.<br/>Persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.<br/>Cons:<br/>Vulnerable to XSS attacks. If an attacker injects malicious JavaScript, they can access the JWT and potentially impersonate the user.<br/>Use Case: Suitable for simpler applications where the risk of XSS is low and ease of implementation is a priority.<br/>Session Storage<br/>Similar to Local Storage but only persists for the duration of the page session. Data is cleared when the page session ends.<br/>Pros:<br/>Provides slightly more security than Local Storage because the token is cleared when the browser or tab is closed.<br/>Easy to implement.<br/>Cons:<br/>Still vulnerable to XSS attacks since JavaScript can access the stored token.<br/>Use Case:<br/>Suitable for applications where user sessions are short-lived and XSS is a lesser concern.<br/>SOLID Principal and real time advantage of each principal<br/>Journey of React. <br/>React is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011 and released to the public in 2013.
